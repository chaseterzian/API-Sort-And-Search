Refactor/Enhancements/Other (Things To Be Done With Extra Time)


____________________________________________________________
MAIN TAKEAWAY:

--Fundamentally alternate and more scalable/upgradable/expandable/efficient solution for matching the query and displaying the information, rather than what I have for this particular dataset (more planning to think big rather than thinking quickly)


____________________________________________________________
FOR CURRENT CODE:

--Determine wheather the query is a number or a string to eliminate extra/unecessary logic

--Revise the logic / add a feature that recognizes if you have typed the exact coutry name, otherwise you may not be able to drill down completely on countries such as Ireland

--Assign a class to each tr outside of the keyup listener main loop, rather than a class to each td inside keyup listener main loop

--Remove duplication and unnecessary repeated code, logic, loops

--Error handling for the API call

--Non superficial loader 

--More available data for each country

--Overall more pleasurable UI

--Cross browser/platform testing
