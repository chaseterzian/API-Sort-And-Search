And I'm not kidding!  Read below to find out how it works.

STEP 1. Click the 'REQUEST INFORMATION' button to load the names of all countries, their regions, and their population counts.

STEP 2. You can then interact with the search field to narrow down the results. You can enter and/or filter by two types of data:

	THE FIRST IS WORDS: 
		Start by typing a name of a country or region. As you type the letters into the search box, the results will be narrowed down according the the words you type.

	THE SECOND IS NUMBERS: 
		Start by typing a number. The results will be narrowed down according to the numbers you type. There are three ways to narrow down your results by typing a number:
		
		1. When typing a number by itself, if that number is present anywhere in the population count of a country, the result will show.

		2. If you put a less-than sign '<' before the number, the result will show all countries with populations less than or equal to the number that you entered. Here are two examples of what you could try entering into the search box:

				Examples: 
				
				<3000 
				OR 
				< 1234 

		3. if you put a greater-than sign '>' before the number, the result will show all countries with populations greater than or equal to the number that you entered. Here are two examples of what you could try entering into the search box:

				Examples:

				>500
				OR
				> 345678


Once you filter the list enough so that only one country remains, you will be presented with more data about the country that includes:
	1. Am image of the country flag
	2. The name of the country
	3. The capital 
	4. The region
	5. The population
	6. The country code
	7. The top level domain for that country 


There's no one to tell us no, or where to go, enjoy the ride!
